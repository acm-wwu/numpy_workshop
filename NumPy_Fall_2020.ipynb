        "\n",
        "From a quick glance, NumPy's main utility appears to be its addition of arrays to Python. With lists already being a data structure built in to Python, this may seem redundant. However, **NumPy arrays are both faster and less memory intensive than Python lists**.\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy arrays only support data of a single type, which allows type checks to run far less often. As well, **vectorized operations allow for repetitive calculations to be sped up by over 100x in some instances** (see Section 3 - NumPy Speed). NumPy also has plenty of useful utilities built-in.\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy has been picked as a base to the vast majority of the data science tooling and libraries in the Python community (including Matplotlib, pandas, TensorFlow, and PyTorch), making it essential knowledge for anyone interested in data science. It is also widely utilized in a variety of scientific computing simulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Nature recently published a paper on NumPy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2), which we recommend for those more interested in a quick overview of the implementation and ecosystem of NumPy."
